# Lab 9 – Take Control: The PID Feedback Controller 

# By: Lily Schlaug and Noah Lane
# Summary
This lab implemented a feedback controller to the robot that was built in a previous lab. The goal of this lab was to create a system that would detect objects at a specified distance and stop the robot from moving forward into the object. The robot continuously checked for an object, so that if the obstacle was removed the robot would begin to move forward again. This was achieved through detection with the ultrasonic sensor. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller was implemented and required tuning to act as the feedback controller of the system. The outcome of this lab was that the robot automatically moved backwards or forwards, depending on the feedback from the controller about how far away the object was detected.
